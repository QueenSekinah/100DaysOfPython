# 100DaysOfPython

Greetings! I'm Sekinah Oladele Ajibike

I recently embarked on the journey of the "100 Days of Python Programming Course" by Angela Yu on Udemy. 

This decision stems from my commitment to enhancing my Python skills and expanding my portfolio. 

Within this repository, you'll find my comprehensive notes and various projects as I progress through the course. 

Feel free to explore my exercises and completed projects listed below. 

Thank you for visiting this repository, and stay tuned for more updates!

### Course guided projects:
#### These are my projects from Day 1 - 80, where the course actually provided a solution for each project. Most of these projects are done by myself, but there are times I took a peek at the solution before completing the projects.
